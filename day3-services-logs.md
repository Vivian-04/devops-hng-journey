Day 3 – Linux Services & Logs

- Learned how systemd manages services
- Used systemctl to start, stop, and enable services
- Installed and managed Nginx web server
- Tested service failure and recovery
- Checked logs using journalctl and nginx logs

Key takeaway:
Logs are the first place to check when services fail.
